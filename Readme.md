## 1. What is Diva

Diva Staking is an Ethereum Liquid Staking protocol powered by Distributed Validator Technology (DVT).

It is a fully integrated tool that improves the lives of Stakers and Operators:

- Stakers receive a Liquid Staking Token (divETH), which acts as a receipt of the ETH staked in the Ethereum network and the rewards generated by said ETH staked.

- Operators run a Distributed Validation (Diva) client to fulfil staking duties and earn Ethereum's rewards.

Each user of the Diva Staking Protocol collects the Ethereum’s staking rewards correspondent with its contributions. You can read more about Diva in the [documentation of the Staking Foundation](https://docs.staking.foundation).

## 2. Motivation

It’s all about Community First. This is not a Token Generation Event but a Community Generation Event. The main principle is to avoid any economic interest prevailing community interests instead. Thus, instead of following the typical airdrop method of rewarding those who have already interacted with the protocol, Diva's early supporter approach is more elaborate and inclusive. Diva Staking initial distribution's main aim is to create a solid community that will spearhead further development of the Diva Staking Protocol; As such, this initial distribution is designed to identify and engage with members of aligned communities, individuals who actively participate in Diva’s governance, and those who genuinely care about the project.

Participation in a DAO isn’t merely about usage but about engaging in discussions, voting, delegating, or simply showing a strong sense of commitment and lack of speculative interest by holding on to airdropped tokens from other protocols.

Moreover, recognizing the value of cross-protocol engagement, individuals involved with multiple protocols have been targeted as potential community members. On that line, the distribution focused mainly on four main groups: Stakers, Operators, DAO participants, and Community OGs who made significant contributions to Ethereum or Diva Staking.

## 3. Initial Distribution Design Parameters

- An oversubscription factor was introduced in the DIVA DAO initial token distribution to guarantee a high percentage of tokens distributed to the community. **`The oversubscription factor is 2x`**, which means that every qualified user can claim 2x the amount that otherwise should be eligible for.

- The total amount of tokens allocated to this initial  DAO distribution is 100,000,000 DIVAs plus an extra amount of 6,000,000 DIVAs to compensate for the variable weights of the community OGs (which are the only group with values that are not as deterministic as for other communities). This adds up to a total of **`106,000,000 DIVAs`** claimable in the initial DAO distribution.

- The initial distribution has been set on a **`First Come First Serve basis`**. Therefore since the oversubscription factor is 2x, it is possible that some eligible addresses don't have the chance to claim their tokens even if they met the criteria below referred.

- This initial DAO distribution will continue until all the DIVA tokens in the contract have been claimed or until **`August 16, 2023, at 6 AM UTC`**, whatever happens first. A front end has been provided to facilitate the claiming process. Such a front end will be maintained just for a period of two weeks, after said period any eligible address will need to interact directly with the smart contract.

- All the eligible **`sub-categories below are additive`**. Therefore, if you qualify for more than one category, the number of claimable tokens adds up.

- **`Snapshots of the qualifying addresses`** were taken for each network at different times. The latest block of each chain that ended with five 0s were chosen:

| Network |  Block number | 
|---|---|
| Ethereum mainnet | `17400000`  | 
| Ethereum Goerli testnet | `9100000`  | 
| Gnosis mainnet | `28400000`  | 

--- 

## 4. Selection criteria

First of all, the DIVA token is not a speculative asset and the issuer wanted to avoid any chance for it to become so. As mentioned before the DIVA token is no more than a tool that when delegated allows to actively participate and become part of a global community of members referred to as the Diva DAO  In order to guarantee that principle techniques to avoid airdrop hunters were introduced, sadly this may imply that some good-faith community members may have been excluded from the airdrop. As said before, the goal is to make the most decentralized staking protocol built by and for the community.

### 4.1 ETH stakers
#### **Diva testnet stakers**

Diva Staking is not in mainnet but it has some parts on testnet. The staking side without the trustless operator mechanism is not much, but it is enough to test some basic functionality and help the teams and individuals working in making Diva Staking a reality to improve the protocol’s architecture. The selected users needed to,

- Stake in the Diva staker UI (`0x6206295407735160F912Dc4eF9ED40110deD4798`) **and** complete a Diva Quest as posted in the [Diva Staking community discord](https://discord.com/channels/1041618287500460083/1044591816546201601/1097909566362099872).

As in any community first project, the ideas and feedback from the community at large are unique and the core of any development process.

| Staking community |  Number of unique addresses selected | DIVAs claimable per address |  Share of the airdrop |  
|---|---|---|---|
| Diva testnet | 66  |  12,000 | 0.40%   | 

#### **Rocket Pool and Lido early mainnet stakers**

They have been true pioneers, and we really admire the first brave stakers that staked their ETHs through Lido and in the Rocket Pool trust-minimized protocol. Diva Staking is to be shaped by like-minded early contributors and adopters, such as the ones who engaged with these liquid staking protocols. Therefore this criteria comes down to,

> **<u>Liquid staking early adopters</u>**
- Staked during the first month of the Rocket Pool mainnet launch contract (`0x4D05E3d48a938db4b7a9A59A802D5b45011BDe58`), **or**
- Staked during the first month of the Lido mainnet launch contract (`0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84`), **or**

> **<u>Decentralization believers</u>**
- Staked not in a single liquid staking protocol, but in both (Lido **and** Rocket Pool) with at least 0.1 ETH in each one of them.

| Staking community |  Number of unique addresses selected | DIVAs claimable per address |  Share of the airdrop |  
|---|---|---|---|
| Rocket Pool early mainnet | 747  |  12,000 | 4.48%   | 
| Lido early mainnet | 1,231  |  12,000 |  7.39%   | 
| 0.1 ETH Lido and 0.1 ETH Rocket Pool mainnet | 688  |  12,000 |  4.13%   | 

#### **EthStaker community**

It's the biggest community within Ethereum fully devoted to providing guidance, education, support, and resources for existing and potential stakers. We consider them a community truly aligned with Diva Staking and Ethereum core values, and for that reason, they will add exceptcional value to the Diva Staking community as well. The most representative stakers and advocates from these communities were chosen by crafting a curated list to avoid airdrop hunters.

| Staking community |  Number of unique addresses selected | DIVAs claimable per address |  Share of the airdrop |  
|---|---|---|---|
| EthStaker community | 122  |  12,000 | 0.73%

### 4.2 Node operators

#### **Ethereum pre-genesis validators**

December 1st, 2020, was a significant milestone for Ethereum. On this day, the Ethereum Proof of Stake genesis block was created thanks to the support of many users. These users sent their very appreciated ETHs to the deposit contract to activate the first step toward the transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake without knowing if it would even work! From this group of brave solo stakers, were selected users that,

- Created at least one validator by depositing 32 ETHs in the Ethereum mainnet deposit contract (`0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa`) **before** Ethereum Proof of Stake genesis block was created on December 1st, 2020. 

| Operator community |  Number of unique addresses selected | DIVAs claimable per address |  Share of the airdrop | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Ethereum pre-genesis validators | 2,010  |  12,000 | 12.06%   | 

#### **Rocket Pool operators**

It is a fair statement to say that Rocket Pool operators are the most aligned with Diva values. The first filter was  Rocket Pool operators that registered at least one mini-pool, as Diva Staking counts on those who are actively participating in Ethereum's staking process and supporting its decentralization. These operators contribute to the network's security and make Ethereum staking accessible to everybody, thereby promoting greater network decentralization. Thus, in this case were selected users that,

- Deposited at least 8 ETHs to create mini-pools in one of the Rocket Pool node deposit contracts (`0xDCD51fc5Cd918e0461B9B7Fb75967fDfD10DAe2f`, `0x1cc9cf5586522c6f483e84a19c3c2b0b6d027bf0` or `0x2fb42ffe2d7df8381853e96304300c6a5e846905`).

| Operator community |  Number of unique addresses selected | DIVAs claimable per address |  Share of the airdrop | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Rocket Pool minipool operators | 2,699 |  12,000 | 16.19%   | 


#### **SSV testnet operators**

Diva Staking is, above all, a project shaped around Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). We want to support operators involved in the testing phase of the DVT networks, specifically those who actively participated and were part of the testnets. These operators showed commitment to improving Ethereum's staking infrastructure, and we would love to count on them to shape the future of Diva Staking. In this case, were selected users that,

- Participated actively in the SSV testnet **and** received at least 30 SSVs as rewards from the DAO testnet incentives (`0xe16e6bddf4a1683c029ddc7aecb567a6095e95a6`).

| Operator community |  Number of unique addresses selected | DIVAs claimable per address |  Share of the airdrop | 
|---|---|---|---|
| SSV testnet operators | 150 |  12,000 | 0.90%   | 


#### **Gnosis + Dappnode operators**

Gnosis serves as a canary network for Ethereum and has become a significant advocate of credible neutrality, client diversity, and decentralization. Further the Gnosis ecosystem has been one of the earliest supporters of the Diva Staking Protocol and a major pillar enabling the development of this project. The Diva Staking community fully aligns with Gnosis values, so  people that staked in Gnosis and run a node, including those who have done so using a Dappnode and benefited from its promotion were included. As these operators have shown commitment and skill in operating within Gnosis, the Diva Staking community would love to welcome them and hope they consider contributing to the Diva Staking infrastructure as well. For that reason, were selected users that,

- Created at least one validator using the Gnosis + Dappnode incentives program contract (`0x6c68322cf55f5f025f2aebd93a28761182d077c3`), or
- Created at least one validator using the Gnosis SBC contract (`0x647507a70ff598f386cb96ae5046486389368c66`), or
- Created at least one validator using the Gnosis deposit contract (`0x0b98057ea310f4d31f2a452b414647007d1645d9`).

| Operator community |  Number of unique addresses selected | DIVAs claimable per address |  Share of the airdrop | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Gnosis + Dappnode operators | 1,325 |  12,000 | 7.95%   |
